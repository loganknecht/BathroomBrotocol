/// <summary>
/// You're going to forget why you created this in the first place.
/// The unity audio source class is just terrible in providing information that lets you knw when it finished. Because of this
/// you created a wrapper that allows you to track the logic of the audio source as it plays through.
/// Typically the audio source's isPlaying variable could be relied on to know if it's playing, but on focus changes and
/// when paused the audio source isPlaying variable is set to false. This means it's unreliable for determining state.
/// On top of this to determine if it finished you could try waiting for isPlaying to return false, but again its state is unreliable.
/// You could also wait to determine if the time has finished, but it resets back to 0 when it has finished. This would be fine if you
/// could determine if the audio source had started, but you can't. SO in order to make tracking the logic easier you created this
/// wrapper for tracking when the audio object is started, when it finishes, and so forth, so that outside logic can infer when to
/// use the audio object itself.
