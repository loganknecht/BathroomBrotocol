Literal Bathroom Brotocol Rules
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Peace and Quiet: If there isn't a bro adjacent to the bro placed in the bathroom object
 - Chatty Cathy: Place two talkative bros next to each other
	- Chatterbox-car Train: consider doing another check down the line to see if there's a chat train (name it something clever)
 - Quarantined: Additional bonus for making a cell phone bro relieve themself with no one around so they aren't annoyed
 - Mellow Yellow: A bro that came in needing to pee was sent to the urinal instead of wasting time on a stall
 - Brown Town: A bro that came in needing to poop was sent to the stall area instead of having him poop in a urinal
 - This Guy Is A Jerk!: One of the few negative brotocol rules, lose points when a bro takes a handicap stall, and there's a handicap bro in the room
